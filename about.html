    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate from Texas A&amp;M University. Coding has always been my interest, and I have been playing with computers
      since day 1. I love coding and love practical application of code to make life easier and more efficient.
      Java is my favorite coding language, a language that introduced me into developing mobile applications. Number-crunching is one
      of my passions, and I have developed a few apps that work to use statistics in your favor when translated to real life application.
      
    <br> <br>
      When not coding, I can be found testing apps in real life, gaming or even doing some commission painting work. I paint 
      at tabletop scale at usually 28mm, but have worked with many different sizes. Currently, I have been painting X-Wing Miniatures 
      in the wake of the Force Awakens.
